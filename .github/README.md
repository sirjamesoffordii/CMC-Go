# `.github/` — GitHub control center

This folder contains (1) GitHub automation and (2) the **active** agent docs.

These docs are written for agents. In a hands-off workflow the operator primarily labels Issues to route work and approves/merges PRs when gates pass.

## Mental model

- Issue templates define *work intake*
- `AGENTS.md` defines *how we operate*
- `.github/agents/*` defines *product + role intent*
- `.github/prompts/*` defines *session activation text*
- `.github/workflows/*` defines *automation*

# `.github/prompts/` — Agent Mode Prompts

These prompts are used to put an agent into a specific operating mode.

## Active prompts

- `tech-lead.prompt.md` — coordination/triage/deconflict mode.
- `software-engineer.prompt.md` — implementation + evidence, or peer verification.
- `loop.prompt.md` — “stay in loop mode until Done.”

## Notes

- Prompts should stay **short and action-oriented**.
- Prompts should **link to policy** (`AGENTS.md`) rather than re-stating it.

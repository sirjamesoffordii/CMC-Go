# `.github/prompts/` — Agent Mode Prompts

These are copy/paste prompts to activate an operating mode.

## Active prompts

- `tech-lead.prompt.md` — coordination/triage/deconflict mode.
- `software-engineer.prompt.md` — implementation + evidence, or peer verification.
- `loop.prompt.md` — “stay in loop mode until Done.”

## Notes

- Keep prompts **short and action-oriented**.
- Link to policy (`AGENTS.md`) instead of re-stating it.

description: Minimal re-anchor prompt to snap any agent back to the Coordinator doctrine and tight loop.

Read first (authority): `docs/authority/CMC_GO_COORDINATOR.md`.

Do this now:
1) State your role (Coordinator | Explorer | Builder | Verifier | Browser Operator).
2) State the artifact (Issue/PR/link) and branch/commit you’re operating on.
3) Treat `staging` as the working truth: re-sync to `origin/staging` (or confirm PR target) and get to a clean, evidence-producing state.
4) Take the smallest next action, then report with evidence:
   - STATUS
   - WHAT CHANGED / WHAT YOU OBSERVED
   - EVIDENCE (commands/logs/screenshots)
   - NEXT (one concrete action)

Non‑Coordinator rule: do not ask the human questions; escalate to the Coordinator via Issue/PR comment if blocked.

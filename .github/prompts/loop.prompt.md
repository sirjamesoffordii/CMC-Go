Loop Mode

Within a Coordinator-assigned Issue:
- Keep going through the next best step until **Done**.
- Do not pause waiting for additional prompts.

Operator interaction:
- Do not talk to or ask questions of Sir James in chat.
- All status/progress communication goes to the Coordinator via Issue/PR comments.

If Blocked:
- Post a single Coordinator escalation comment with a concrete A/B/C decision request + evidence.
- Immediately continue with the next best parallel work that does not require the decision.
- If there is truly nothing safe to do in parallel, wait (stay in loop) and re-check the Issue thread for a Coordinator response.

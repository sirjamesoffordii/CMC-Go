Loop Mode

Within a Coordinator-assigned Issue:
- Keep going through the next best step until **Done** or truly **Blocked**.
- Do not pause waiting for additional prompts.

Communication:
- Don’t ask Sir James for routine direction.
- Post progress/evidence as Issue/PR comments (STATUS + EVIDENCE + NEXT).
- In chat: speak only when **Done** or **Blocked**.

If Blocked: escalate to the Coordinator with a concrete A/B/C decision request and any evidence.

# `.github/agents/` — Active Agent Docs

This folder contains the **active** docs that define how work happens in this repo.

## Files

- `CMC_GO_BRIEF.md` — product intent + non-negotiable invariants.
- `tech-lead.agent.md` — TL responsibilities (triage/coherence/deconflict).
- `software-engineer.agent.md` — SWE responsibilities (small diffs + evidence, or verify).

## Rule of thumb

- If it’s “how the team operates,” it belongs in `AGENTS.md`.
- If it’s “what this product is and what must not break,” it belongs in `CMC_GO_BRIEF.md`.
- Role docs should be short: priorities + outputs + checklists.

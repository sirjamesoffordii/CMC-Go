# `.github/agents/` — Active Agent Docs

This folder contains the **active** product + role docs.

## Files

- `CMC_GO_BRIEF.md` — product intent + non-negotiable invariants.
- `tech-lead.agent.md` — TL responsibilities (triage/coherence/deconflict).
- `software-engineer.agent.md` — SWE responsibilities (small diffs + evidence, or verify).

## Rules

- Operating policy lives in `AGENTS.md`.
- Product intent + invariants live in `CMC_GO_BRIEF.md`.
- Role docs stay short: priorities + outputs + checklists.

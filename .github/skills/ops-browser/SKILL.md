# Skill: Ops + Browser Tasks (Railway/Sentry/Codecov)

Use this skill for web-console tasks and visual verification.

## Principles
- Follow the Issue checklist exactly.
- Capture evidence (screenshots/notes) WITHOUT exposing secrets.
- Record what changed and how to confirm.

## Evidence checklist
- Service (Railway/Sentry/Codecov)
- Page/section where change occurred
- Setting changed (name only, not value)
- Confirmation step (what proves it worked)

## If blocked
- Report where you got blocked (login/permission/2FA)
- Suggest the smallest User action needed to proceed

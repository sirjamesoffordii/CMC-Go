# `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` — Issue Templates

These templates keep Issues consistent so TL can make them executable and SWE can implement with evidence.

## What’s here

- `feature_task.md` — default TL/SWE work item (Goal/Scope/AC/Verification)
- `ops_task.md` — ops/deployment/console tasks (Railway/Sentry/Codecov)

## Guideline

If you’re not sure which template to pick: start with `feature_task.md`.

## Archived templates

Role-specific templates (Builder/Verifier/Explorer/Coordinator/Browser) are archived under `.github/_unused/issue_templates/` to keep the active repo aligned to the TL/SWE operating model.

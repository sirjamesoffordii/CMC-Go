# CMC Go — Overview

## What is CMC Go?

**CMC Go** is a map-first coordination and visibility platform built to help Chi Alpha leaders **see, track, and mobilize people toward the Campus Missions Conference (CMC)**.

At its core, CMC Go answers three questions for leaders at every level (national, regional, district, campus):

- Who is invited?
- Who is going?
- What still needs follow-up?

CMC Go replaces fragmented spreadsheets, text threads, and guesswork with a **shared, real-time system of record** that is simple, visual, and reliable.

---

## Core Principles

CMC Go is intentionally built around the following principles:

### 1. Map-First Clarity

The map is the primary interface.

Leaders understand momentum geographically. CMC Go makes progress visible by:

- Region
- District
- Campus

This allows leaders to immediately identify:

- Areas of strength
- Areas needing follow-up
- Gaps in invitation or engagement

---

### 2. Status Before Features

CMC Go prioritizes **correctness and clarity over polish**.

Before adding animations, mobile optimizations, or advanced UX, the system ensures:

- Data is accurate
- State is consistent
- Behavior is predictable

A system that looks good but lies is worse than a system that is plain but trustworthy.

---

### 3. Single Source of Truth

CMC Go is designed to be the **authoritative record** for CMC readiness.

That means:

- One person equals one record
- One status per person (Going / Maybe / Not Going / Not Invited)
- Notes and needs are attached directly to people
- Filters and views never mutate underlying data

If it’s not in CMC Go, it’s not considered real.

---

### 4. Leader-Friendly by Design

CMC Go is not built for engineers or administrators — it is built for **busy leaders**.

Design decisions prioritize:

- Fast scanning
- Obvious next actions
- Minimal clicks
- Clear defaults

Every view should answer the question: _“What do I need to do next?”_

---

## What CMC Go Is (and Is Not)

### CMC Go **IS**

- A coordination and visibility tool
- A follow-up and accountability aid
- A real-time snapshot of readiness
- A shared system across leadership layers

### CMC Go **IS NOT**

- A CRM replacement
- A registration system
- A messaging platform
- A vanity reporting dashboard

CMC Go complements existing systems rather than replacing them.

## Project Philosophy

> **Make it correct.  
> Make it clear.  
> Make it trustworthy.  
> Then make it fast and beautiful.**

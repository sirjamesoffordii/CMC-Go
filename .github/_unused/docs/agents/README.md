# Archived agent docs (`.github/_unused/docs/agents/`)

This folder contains **legacy** agent documentation that is not part of the active operating model.

## Status

- These files are **archived**.
- Internal links may be stale.
- Active policy lives in `AGENTS.md` and `.github/agents/`.

## What’s inside

- `legacy/` — historical doctrine (Coordinator, Build Map, old toolkits)
- `operational-procedures/` — archived operational procedures
- `old-brief/` — previous “overview/authority” style docs

If you want to revive any of this, move it into an active location and update links to match the current structure.

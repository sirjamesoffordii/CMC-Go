# Archived / Unused GitHub + agent artifacts

This folder holds legacy or currently-unused GitHub/agent files that we intentionally keep for reference.

## Expectations

- Do not treat anything under `.github/_unused/` as active policy.
- Active agent docs live under `.github/agents/`.
- Active prompts live under `.github/prompts/` (currently TL/SWE + loop).

If something here becomes relevant again, move it back into an active location and update references.

## What’s in here

- `.github/_unused/agents/` — inactive role definitions (kept for reference)
- `.github/_unused/prompts/` — inactive prompts
- `.github/_unused/issue_templates/` — archived role-specific Issue templates
- `.github/_unused/docs/agents/` — archived agent docs
	- `legacy/` — historical docs (e.g., coordinator doctrine, old build map)
	- `operational-procedures/` — archived operational procedures
	- `old-brief/` — previous “overview/authority” style docs

Note: archived docs may contain stale internal links; treat them as historical reference.

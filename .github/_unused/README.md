# Archived / Unused GitHub + agent artifacts

This folder holds legacy or currently-unused GitHub/agent files that we intentionally keep for reference.

## Expectations

- Do not treat anything under `.github/_unused/` as active policy.
- Active agent docs live under `.github/agents/`.
- Active prompts live under `.github/prompts/` (currently TL/SWE + loop).

If something here becomes relevant again, move it back into an active location and update references.

This document governs **build progression and verification** for CMC Go. Phase definitions and advancement rules live here; day-to-day execution tracking lives in the **Operational board** above.

Maintenance rule: the **Coordinator** updates this file when a PR meaningfully changes build position/scope, and keeps the Operational board's milestones/statuses in sync.

## Latest Work Update

**Current Position:** Phase 1.2 — Cross-View Consistency & Reliability

Latest work has been focused on validating cross-view state behavior, with particular attention on map ↔ panel synchronization and follow-up view consistency. Progress has been steady but non-trivial: most core logic is in place, however verification is ongoing to ensure no edge-case desyncs remain.

Recent friction has come from environment and deployment issues (Sentry env vars and lockfile mismatches), which temporarily slowed verification but did not change scope. No fundamental blockers are present; remaining work is primarily careful validation rather than new implementation.

Recent coordination/doc stabilization work landed in `staging`:
- Merge of `agent/docs/agent-playbook-nav` into `staging` (commit `3469e19`)
- Fix GitHub Issue discovery link quoting for `role:coordinator` label (commit `5a1c844`)
